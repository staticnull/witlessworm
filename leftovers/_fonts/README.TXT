About Zoink Fat
*************

Zoink Fat is a font I did years ago, based on an old Mac font called GilbertShelton. When I first started doing design (many years ago when the Mac Plus was the top of the line), there was a font available called GilbertShelton, but it was only available in bitmap format. Basically, I did my best to create an outline font from the largest available screen font. 

The name is a nod to the fight scenes on the old Batman TV series (and to Shaggy on Scooby Doo...).

Freeware. This is all there is.
